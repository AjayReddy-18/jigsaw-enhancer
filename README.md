# Jigsaw Employee Enhancer

A Chrome browser extension that enhances the Jigsaw internal company website by automatically displaying gender pronouns and symbols next to employee names.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Works on account detail pages (URL pattern: `/accounts/{id}/details`)
- **Gender Symbols**: Displays appropriate symbols next to employee names:
  - 🏳️‍🌈 for non-binary/they pronouns
  - 🔵 for male
  - 🔴 for female
- **Smart Caching**: Caches employee data to avoid repeated API calls
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Automatically detects new employee elements added to the page
- **Beautiful UI**: Large, prominent symbols with hover effects and color coding

## How It Works

1. **Page Detection**: The extension automatically activates when you visit a Jigsaw account page
2. **Employee Extraction**: Finds all employee name elements with class `timeline-consultant-name`
3. **Data Integration**: Retrieves employee information for each employee
4. **Symbol Display**: Analyzes employee data and displays appropriate gender symbols:
   - If `pronouns.english.they` is `true` → 🏳️‍🌈
   - If `preferredGender` is `male` → 🔵
   - If `preferredGender` is `female` → 🔴
