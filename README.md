# Jigsaw Employee Enhancer

A Chrome browser extension that enhances the Jigsaw internal company website by automatically displaying gender pronouns and symbols next to employee names.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Works on account detail pages (URL pattern: `/accounts/{id}/details`)
- **Gender Symbols**: Displays appropriate symbols next to employee names:
  - üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà for non-binary/they pronouns
  - üîµ for male
  - üî¥ for female
- **Smart Caching**: Caches employee data to avoid repeated API calls
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Automatically detects new employee elements added to the page
- **Beautiful UI**: Large, prominent symbols with hover effects and color coding

## How It Works

1. **Page Detection**: The extension automatically activates when you visit a Jigsaw account page
2. **Employee Extraction**: Finds all employee name elements with class `timeline-consultant-name`
3. **Data Integration**: Retrieves employee information for each employee
4. **Symbol Display**: Analyzes employee data and displays appropriate gender symbols:
   - If `pronouns.english.they` is `true` ‚Üí üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
   - If `preferredGender` is `male` ‚Üí üîµ
   - If `preferredGender` is `female` ‚Üí üî¥
