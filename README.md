# Jigsaw Employee Enhancer

A Chrome browser extension that enhances the Jigsaw internal company website by automatically displaying gender pronouns and symbols next to employee names, with the ability to filter employees by gender.

## Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Works on account detail pages (URL pattern: `/accounts/{id}/details`) and consultant profile pages (URL pattern: `/consultants/{id}`)
- **Gender Symbols**: Displays appropriate symbols next to employee names:
  - üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà for non-binary/they pronouns
  - üîµ for male
  - üî¥ for female
- **LinkedIn Integration**: Adds LinkedIn search links next to employee grades on consultant profile pages
- **Gender Filtering**: Filter employees by gender using a dropdown with options:
  - All (default)
  - Male
  - Female
  - Non-binary
  - Unspecified
- **Smart Caching**: Caches employee data to avoid repeated API calls
- **Dynamic Content Support**: Automatically detects new employee elements added to the page
- **Beautiful UI**: Large, prominent symbols with hover effects and color coding

## How It Works

1. **Page Detection**: The extension automatically activates when you visit a Jigsaw account page or consultant profile page
2. **Employee Extraction**: 
   - On account pages: Finds all employee name elements with class `timeline-consultant-name`
   - On consultant profile pages: Finds the grade element with class `gradeName__27b12`
3. **Data Integration**: Retrieves employee information for each employee from the Jigsaw API
4. **Symbol Display**: Analyzes employee data and displays appropriate gender symbols:
   - If `pronouns.english.they` is `true` ‚Üí üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
   - If `preferredGender` is `male` ‚Üí üîµ
   - If `preferredGender` is `female` ‚Üí üî¥
5. **LinkedIn Enhancement**: On consultant profile pages, adds a LinkedIn search link next to the employee's grade that searches for the employee on LinkedIn
6. **Gender Filtering**: Adds a filter dropdown to the existing filter container that allows hiding/showing employees based on gender selection

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working

1. **Check the console**: Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for "Jigsaw Enhancer" messages
2. **Verify URL pattern**: Ensure you're on a page matching `/accounts/{id}/details`
3. **Check permissions**: Verify the extension has access to jigsaw.thoughtworks.net
4. **Reload the page**: Sometimes a page refresh is needed after installation

### Gender Filter Not Appearing

1. **Check if filter container exists**: The gender filter is added to the existing filter section
2. **Verify page structure**: Ensure the page has the expected filter container with class `filterContainer__6d09b`
3. **Check console for errors**: Look for "Gender filter added" message in the console

### API Errors

- **Network issues**: Check if you can access the Jigsaw API directly
- **Authentication**: Ensure you're logged into Jigsaw
- **Rate limiting**: The extension includes caching to minimize API calls

### LinkedIn Integration Not Working

1. **Check if you're on a consultant profile page**: Ensure the URL matches `/consultants/{id}` pattern
2. **Verify the grade element exists**: Look for an element with class `gradeName__27b12`
3. **Check console for errors**: Look for "Enhanced grade element with LinkedIn link" message
4. **Employee data not found**: The extension needs to successfully fetch employee data from the API
5. **Page navigation**: If using browser back/forward, the extension should automatically detect the change

## Development

To modify the extension:

1. **Edit the files** in your local copy
2. **Reload the extension** in `chrome://extensions/`
3. **Refresh the Jigsaw page** to see changes

## Security Notes
